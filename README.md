# Black Game Developers
A list of Black people who make games. Here they are. Hire them. Buy their stuff.

## Want to add someone to the list?
There are three ways to do so.

### The good way (quickest)

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `TEMPLATES` folder and choose `PERSON-COPY-ME.mdx` or `COMPANY-COPY-ME.mdx` depending on whether your submission is one person or a studio (both is also fine)
3. Duplicate the file and save it in the `directory` folder as your name with underscores instead of spaces (for example: `Catt_Small.mdx`)
4. Edit and save the file
5. Create and submit a pull request for us to review

### The acceptable way
[Create a GitHub issue here](https://github.com/QuantumBox/blackgamedevs/issues) and include the person's name and website(s). We will get to it when we can.

### The hard way (slowest)
Send a tweet to [@cattsmall](http://twitter.com/cattsmall), [@edibletoaster](http://twitter.com/edibletoaster), or [@chrisalgoo](http://twitter.com/chrisalgoo). This is hardest for us. There is no guarantee we'll see your request.

2. Install yarn by running `npm install -g yarn` in your terminal.

3. Then you can run `yarn` in your terminal while inside the project directory to install project dependencies.

4. After the installation completes, run `yarn start` to spin up your development environment. When it says `SUCCESS`, open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
